# Adam Nyitrai Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
This project is about recreating the portfolio website I created previously, this time by using Bootstrap to complete the project. The website contains a short introduction of myself, some of my previous project with links to the deployed applications, contact information and the list of skills I expect to learn from this bootcamp.
